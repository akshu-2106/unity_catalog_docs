- Create a data catalog of data assets present in the Lakehouse
- Offer a lineage view on data origin & usage across jobs/notebooks running in Databricks
- Allow for data sharing in a governed managed way
- & like – over time – much more

In a nutshell, ***Unity Catalog is a unified governance solution for all data and AI assets including files, tables, and machine learning models in your lakehouse on any cloud.***
